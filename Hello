Hi there,

Welcome to my GitHub! Here I plan to build, post and collate notable pieces of code I use throughout my journey as a Data Analyst. It might be a bit quiet at the moment, but that's just a sign that things are on their way :)

Feel free to have a look around and please do not hesitate to reach out if you see something that catches your eye or even if you just want to know more or chat,

Have a great day!

Jack
